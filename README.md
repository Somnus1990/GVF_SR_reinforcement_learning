# General Value Functions and Successor Representation

This is a report on the topic of Successor Representation (SR). It briefly discusses the relation between SR and the General Value Functions and then proceeds to explore the properties of SR and its benefits over vanilla TD(0) methods. The experiments performed for the purposes of this study are all done on the [FrozenLake](https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake-v0/) environment with slight modifications that are mentioned in the report.

* This entire report was done using Google Colaboratory and you can view the ipython notebook [here](https://github.com/rezazzr/GVF_SR_reinforcement_learning/blob/master/GVF_SR.ipynb).
